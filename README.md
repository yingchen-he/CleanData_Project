CleanData_Project
=================
## This project is the peer-reviewed project for the Coursera course called Getting and Cleaning Data.

There are three other files in this repo:
- run_analysis.R: This is the code for cleaning the data. The data was downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
- CodeBook.md: This is the code book describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I've done to clean up the data.
- tidy\_data\_long.txt, tidy\_data\_wide.txt, tidy\_data\_average\_long.txt & tidy\_data\_average\_long.txt: These are tidy data sets in the long/wide format.
